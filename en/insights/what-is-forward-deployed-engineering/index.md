# What is Forward Deployed Engineering?

Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) is a delivery model in which engineers work close to a customer’s real operating environment and connect problem discovery, software implementation, deployment, and outcome validation in one continuous loop.

**Not a job title only** — FDE describes an operating model

**Closer to reality** — Requirements are learned in the workflow

**Measured in outcomes** — Software is part of the intervention

## The core idea

Traditional delivery often separates diagnosis, specification, implementation, and adoption across different teams. FDE keeps those activities close enough that field evidence can change the solution.

### Discover in context

Engineers observe how work is actually performed, including exceptions and informal handoffs.

### Build with operators

Domain experts and engineers test assumptions against real cases rather than a frozen brief.

### Validate the change

The team compares the agreed baseline with post-intervention evidence and inspects unintended effects.

## When not to use FDE

FDE is not automatically better for every software project.

### Stable commodity need

A standard product is usually preferable when requirements and workflows are already well understood.

### No access to operators

FDE cannot work well when the team cannot observe the process or receive timely evidence.

### No measurable boundary

The engagement needs an agreed problem, responsible owner, and a way to judge whether the intervention helped.

## Delivery method

### Choose the problem

Select a valuable workflow with an accountable owner and observable current state.

### Establish the baseline

Define quality, time, cost, risk, or throughput using a documented measurement method.

### Run a bounded intervention

Deploy the smallest complete change that can influence the chosen outcome.

### Decide from evidence

Scale, revise, or stop based on results and known limitations.

## Frequently asked questions

Is FDE the same as embedded engineering?

They overlap, but FDE usually adds explicit ownership of discovery, implementation, and validation around a customer problem.

Is FDE the same as professional services?

FDE may be delivered as a professional service, but its defining feature is the tight field evidence and engineering loop, not the commercial contract type.

Why is FDE relevant to enterprise AI?

AI requirements often depend on real data, exceptions, permissions, user judgement, and model failure modes. These are difficult to specify accurately without testing inside the operating context.

## Start with one concrete operating problem.

We will first clarify the workflow, evidence, data boundary, and outcome standard before recommending the next step.
