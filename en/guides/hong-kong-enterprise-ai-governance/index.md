Hong Kong AI governance guide

# What governance does a Hong Kong enterprise need before deploying AI?

Start from the affected workflow and personal-data boundary. Then assign accountability, classify risk, set human authority, test the complete system, and keep evidence after launch.

[Book a project assessment](mailto:info@onyxdevslab.com?subject=What%20governance%20does%20a%20Hong%20Kong%20enterprise%20need%20before%20deploying%20AI%3F) [繁體中文](/zh-hk/guides/enterprise-ai-governance/) [简体中文](/zh-cn/guides/enterprise-ai-governance/)

**Governance owner** — Named authority and escalation

**Risk-based control** — Oversight follows consequence

**Lifecycle evidence** — Test, monitor, and communicate

## Four governance duties

The Hong Kong PCPD Model Framework groups its recommendations into four operational areas.

### Strategy and governance

Set an organisational AI strategy, procurement controls, accountable governance body, policies, training, and internal responsibilities.

### Risk assessment and human oversight

Assess likely benefits and harms, classify risk, choose mitigation, and define when a person reviews, overrides, or stops the system.

### Implementation and lifecycle management

Control data preparation, model customisation, validation, security, deployment, monitoring, incidents, and retirement.

### Communication and engagement

Give employees, suppliers, affected people, and regulators timely information and channels for questions, feedback, and incidents.

## Turn principles into delivery evidence

A policy is only useful when teams can show how it changes the system and workflow.

### Data and purpose register

Record the intended use, personal data involved, provenance, retention, access, cross-border movement, and prohibited uses.

### Decision and authority map

Separate advice, drafting, approval, and execution; name the accountable owner and escalation route for each consequential action.

### Release and monitoring record

Keep test cases, risk-tier thresholds, failures, mitigations, approvals, versions, drift signals, incidents, and review dates.

## Delivery method

### Define one use case

Name the users, purpose, affected people, data, systems, expected benefit, and consequence of error.

### Assign risk and authority

Choose controls and human oversight based on impact rather than treating every AI feature alike.

### Validate end to end

Test data handling, retrieval, outputs, tools, permissions, fallbacks, notices, and human handoff with realistic cases.

### Operate an evidence loop

Monitor performance and incidents, collect stakeholder feedback, review material changes, and preserve decisions.

## Frequently asked questions

Is this checklist legal advice?

No. It is an implementation guide grounded in public regulator materials. Organisations should obtain legal, privacy, security, and sector-specific advice for their facts.

Does using a third-party model transfer accountability to the vendor?

No. Procurement should clarify responsibilities, but the deploying organisation still needs governance for its purpose, data, workflow, users, and consequences.

Is a chatbot disclaimer enough human oversight?

No. Oversight must match risk and include meaningful authority, information, timing, escalation, and the ability to intervene.

## Start with one concrete operating problem.

We will first clarify the workflow, evidence, data boundary, and outcome standard before recommending the next step.
